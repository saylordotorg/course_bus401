**Unit 2: Leadership Theory** <span id="2"></span> 
*People have studied leadership since ancient times, and theories of
leadership have been around for centuries (Plato, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli,
etc.); however, it wasn’t until the 20<sup>th</sup> century that the
modern theories began to take shape.  Today, researchers study
leadership the same way that they study other aspects of psychology:
they seek to get a better understanding of people’s behavior and
motivation. *  
  
 *The problem with some of these theories is that they tend to
contradict instead of complement each other.  They seek to identify one
set of rules or behaviors that turns someone into a leader.  The reality
is likely a combination of all the theories and some ideas that have yet
to be defined.  It is best to study these theories with an open mind and
understand that they each have their own merits.  Remember that emphasis
should not be placed on any one theory.*

**2.1 Trait Theory** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: Trait theory concerning management is the belief that leaders are
born with certain characteristics (or traits) that make them successful;
in other words, being a leader is innate or based on the qualities of
one’s personality.  This theory assumes that a person who* *is* *born
with certain traits will ultimately be a great leader.*
