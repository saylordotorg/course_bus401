**Unit 1: Introduction** <span id="1"></span> 
*What are management and leadership?  What is the purpose of studying
how to lead a team?  Aren’t all leaders born and not made?  If that is
the truth, then millions of people are wasting their time trying to
improve their leadership skills.  Fortunately, trying to become a better
leader is not a waste of time.  While it is true that some leaders are
born, most are made by studying what makes an effective leader.*  
  
 *In this introductory unit, you will explore the four pillars of good
management: management, leadership, groups, and teams.  Management and
leadership are often used interchangeably; the same applies for groups
and teams.  Management is about allocating resources; leadership is
about empowering people.  A group is a collection of individuals with a
similar interest.  Teams have a similar goal, but teams work
together.  A good leader will help a group and become a team.*  
  
 *To prepare you for this course, this unit concludes with a look at
some great leaders in history.  These four individuals are selected for
their broad experiences and abilities to manage groups and teams.  The
spectrum goes from sports team management to inspiring political
movements, and from brilliant corporate management to excellence in
military and national leadership.*

*Note: This subunit is covered by the Rapid Intellect article assigned
beneath* *subunit 1.1.3.*

**1.2 Great Leaders** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Note: There are thousands of leaders that have graced the pages of
history, and there are many more who may have crossed your own path in
life.  Certainly no two leaders are exactly alike.  The four leaders
discussed below are all well known, but they are four very different
people that lived in different times and circumstances.  Each has
approached their role as a leader based on their personality and
developed a style of leadership that suited their situation.  Each has
been effective in his own way.  The examples below, while well-known and
often discussed in the business world, are not the only successful
leaders; certainly there are others that will come to mind as you read
the leadership bios below.  As you learn about these famous leaders,
consider which of Lewin’s leadership styles (see sub-subunit 1.1.2) each
leader exemplifies.  You may also want to keep a running journal of
their similarities as well as their differences, and you will have an
opportunity to review your findings in the guided reading questions
provided at the end of this unit.*
