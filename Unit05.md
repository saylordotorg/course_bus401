**Unit 5: Managing Groups and Teams** <span id="5"></span> 
*Whether your power base is legitimate or otherwise, you may find
yourself potentially in a leadership position within a group or team. 
But what is the difference between a group and a team?  This was touched
on in the first unit, but further distinction is needed here.  Groups
are often formed organically.  Think about a group of car
enthusiasts: they come together because of a similar interest.  There
may not be an underlying goal other than to share ideas and discuss
topics of mutual interest.  Teams are formed more strategically.  For
example, think about a professional sports team; management carefully
selects and trains players, and together they work toward the common
goal of winning games. *  
  
 *Teams should function in the way a group does: with a more relaxed
atmosphere, which will allow each contributor to feel comfortable in his
or her role.  Maintaining this atmosphere can be difficult, because
teams sometimes work in very stressful environments.  This is why
building a good team with great dynamics is so important and so
challenging.  A team that functions well together will be more
productive than a team that does not have a good dynamic.  Thus, this
unit will enable you to explore the world of teams and groups.  You will
learn about the internal processes that underlie team/group formation
and maintenance as well as the role of leadership in these types of
settings.  The unit opens with a discussion of diversity.  While the
value of diversity in an organization is not restricted to team
processes, scholars and business practitioners both agree that team
performance is improved by a diverse membership.*  
  
 *As stated throughout, this course will not make you a good leader or
member of a team, but it can give you the tools that will help you
recognize what makes a team effective and identify the players that
serve best as leaders.*
