**Unit 3: Change Management and Decision-Making** <span id="3"></span> 
*The most difficult task for a manager is implementing changes without
disrupting the whole business.  Changes to the normal business operation
will have supporters and protestors.  It is important for a manager to
understand the point of views from both sides.  Sometimes the changes
are minor, such as a new benefits plan.  Other times major changes must
be made, such as moving the operations across the country and laying off
employees.  The only certainty with change is that you cannot please
everyone, but a good manager will anticipate reactions and focus on
effective communication.*  
  
 *Both major and minor changes are often the result of a decision-making
process.  There are many different ways to approach a decision, and each
method has an appropriate time and place.  Decisions can be based on
dictatorial edicts, on a leader’s decision derived from consultation
with subordinates, or on a more collective process where everyone can
develop and agree on the final outcome.  These methods will be presented
in this unit.  In addition, one must also address the real probability
that decisions, regardless of the process by which they are derived,
will be clouded by any of a number of biases.  We present the most
critical of those biases, including anchoring, “groupthink” and
selective perception in this unit as well.*

**3.1.2 Lewin’s Three-Step Model of Change** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: The social scientist, Kurt Lewin, believed that change functions
as a balance of forces that either drives employees toward a goal
(driving force) or pulls employees in opposite directions (restraining
force).  He understood that change happens as a process, and he
developed a three-step model of change in order to successfully
transition through planned change.  The first stage, considered
“unfreeze” is to prepare a business or organization for the change, the
second stage is to relieve any uncertainty after the change is
implemented, and the last stage is “refreeze” or maintaining that the
changes are being used appropriately.*

**3.2.4 Satisficing** <span id="3.2.4"></span> 
*Note: Satisficing is a strategy, where a decision is settled upon as
being “good enough” instead of working on an optimal solution.  A team
may do this to evade incurring additional costs or using extra resources
that may come with deciding on an ideal solution.*

**3.2.5 Biases** <span id="3.2.5"></span> 
*Note: Biases are a regular part of everyday life.  The best way to
avoid a bias when making a decision is to pretend you are seeing all
available information for the first time.  History’s successes and
failures may help when making decisions, but they run the risk of
influencing decisions when the situation is not the same.*

over the others, or because the group is not motivated to resolve the
issue. *
