**Unit 4: Leading Without Formal Authority** <span id="4"></span> 
*While many students of this course will go on to manage teams,
organizations, and companies, everyone will have opportunities to lead
without being granted any actual authority (called “legitimate power”). 
To leverage these opportunities, you must know what types of power exist
and when to use them.  For example, having expert power allows someone
to step-up, because they have the most knowledge about a specific
subject.*  
  
 *Leading without authority goes beyond power; the ability to influence
without manipulation, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills
are all important aspects of gaining power and leadership without having
direct authority over a group or team.  After studying these topics, you
will be able to recognize when a leader takes over a situation and to
determine who may be the best leader for a given situation. *
